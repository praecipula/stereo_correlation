# Stereo correlation

| Hello, happy viewers!|
|:--------------------:|

While I hope this document is interesting, it's also a fairly long spec for a program, so it's kinda a long read. The far-reaching goal is to reconstruct 3D scene geometry from stereo images. If you wish to skip the section about stereo image composition, start [at this heading](#a-performant-scalable-and-distributable-method-for-mesh-generation-and-sensor-fusion-for-point-clouds); to add context for the point cloud generation you can look just before it at the "Generation of 3D scene from disparity data" feature.


------


This project exists because there are no maintained, modern, cross-platform projects for editing and compositing two side by side images into one stereo image of varying formats, particularly with a process oriented toward artistic interpretation. Existing solutions are either overly engineered for a particular task, hard to automate for simple tasks, built for one specific platform and one set of cameras, overly simplistic, or lack certain useful features for content creation.

Theory:
------

The main method of constructing a 3d image is to recreate our vision system's ability to view a scene with a slight displacement between the eyes. By taking a picture with 2 cameras with a slight offset to each other (or, equivalently, if the scene is static, taking 2 pictures, one after the other, with the camera shifted horizontally slightly - the "cha-cha" method), it is possible to provide the 2 images necessary for our eyes to reconstruct the 3D scene.

(Note: you need a set of anaglyph glasses to view the following examples)

Motivation:
------

A prototype using Ruby, Qt, ImageMagick, and Cairo was built to serve as a tool to reconstruct anaglyphs from side-by-side point-and-shoot snapshots. One of the original purposes of the Ruby library - to create a "layers and canvas with DSL operations" - was achieved, but at the cost of inconvenience of using toolkits in an awkward way. Specifically, for performance reasons, the Cairo interface was built using [recording surfaces](http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Recording-Surfaces.html); these essentially manage a buffer of operations, which when the image is actually rendered, compile and execute lazily the set of instructions. A camera upgrade required that ImageMagick be called, rather than before or after the Cairo steps, right in the middle. The state of ImageMagick on Ruby is only so-so: there are native libraries to handle the interface between the dynamic libraries and the Ruby language, but these are notorious for memory leaks and poor performance, owing to the fact that Ruby doesn't have guaranteed destructors, which is _the_ main way of dealing with resource lifetime management in C++. It's too easy to accidentally allocate dynamic memory without knowing you did so. Calling ImageMagick with command-line exec statements, another common approach, requires either the generation of a command-line statement composing library and is not cross-platform, or using a library like RMagick to manage the interaction, but workflows of this type almost always incur multiple image buffers being written to disk as tempfiles.

This project deserved a native implementation. I decided to port over to C++, which I'm quite familiar with having worked for years as a native app software guy, for direct access to the tools and libraries used to make this project work. Features at time of completion will be:


* 2-image correlation of the left and right images (visual alignment)
* Basic rotation and skew transforms (camera rig error correction)
* Composable or programmable pipeline (construct a processing DAG similar to Unreal's [Blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/index.html) for scripting workflow functionality)
* Red-cyan anaglyph generation as a possible output format
* Enhanced (color-reconstituted) anaglyph as a possible output format
* Wigglegram generation as a possible output format
* JPS file generation as a possible output format
* Crop and resize capability as a pipeline step - trimming uncorrelated border pixels between images
* Floating frame generation as a pipeline step, to fix edge violations for foreground geometry
* Annotation and signature as a pipeline step, just to say the author was here
* Lens undistort as a pipeline step, allowing for better camera callibration.
* Automated correlation finding, to provide suitable "candidates" for selection of the view frame point - the point of exact pixel coordinate overlap of the geometry captured in left and right images.


Stretch features:
* Batch processing of frames from side-by-side captured movies for generation of 3D movies.
* Generation of 3D scene from disparity data (construct geometry which allows small amounts of rotation and translation of the recreated scene for a "shadow box" effect)

Project status:
------

I have just begun my port into C++ in my spare time, so there are definitely some things lacking. Documentation (other than this overview) and testing are quite poor, to my standards, in terms of completion - documentation is just dev notes, and testing is a few meager unit tests and hand-comparison to known good outputs from the prototype. This is not due to a lack of caring or a lack of awareness, but rather an attempt to recreate this project at a similar completion level as the prototype, which will allow me to focus on the native implementation for my uses.

Documentation will be handled with Doxygen, testing is using google test.

A deeper look into the features
------

* 2-image correlation of the left and right images

Given a view which displays the left and the right image as taken by the camera, it is possible to define the apparent depth of the image plane in the scene by the selection of how the images are displaced relative to each other. The point on the image where both features overlap precisely - that is, the pixel coordinate at which the exact same spot lies in the real-world geometry; the features are perfectly superimposed from both images - this point is the apparent location of the image plane. It's the "screen-level" depth of the image to the viewer, which allows the compositor to choose whether items in the scene pop out of the screen or descend into it. Using a mouse-based selection of this point on each image, we can calculate the operations needed to properly align and compose the images on top of one another.

Status in prototype: 100% (fully working)

Status in native: 75% (the view and basic UI exist, but the data model is in process and no operations are yet done to correlate the images together).

* Basic rotation and skew transforms

Constructing 2 lenses side-by-side, whether on one housing or with twinned cameras, has a problem: it's very difficult to build a rig that has precise tolerances which will result in perfect image alignment. Slight manufacturing or mounting issues can result in an image which has one camera slighty rotated relative to the other; additionally, except where very highly toleranced lenses are used, the images may inherently have different pincushion/barrel and skew distortions. A set of basic transforms to align other points in the image (other than the point of overlap) can correct for these real-world phenomenon. This can be some sort of functional transform, like a [cubic lens distortion](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/distorts/#barrel), or a manual point-by-point [control point distortion](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/distorts/#control_points) to really get fine control of the results.

Status in prototype: 0% (relied on strong camera rig construction; slight rotations of 1-2 degrees done in preprocessing by hand when necessary)

Status in native: 0%

* Composable or programmable pipeline

It's possible to have different workflows for images: for instance, we may want to have a floating frame to correct for edge violations for a certain image, or we may not, or we may want to undistort lens parameters at a certain step in the processing pipeline (i.e. before or after alignment). This feature revolves around using the [command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) in order to allow a user-composeable pipeline of operations that chain to form the complete workflow. A DAG is constructed, such that the head nodes could be, for example, opening a left and right image; these are then combined to an overlay node, framed with a floating frame node, forked to an anaglyph and a SBS image processing set of sibling nodes, and output to a JPG and JPS file respectively. This DAG is intended to be more or less the serializable canonical model used in the program; opening a serialized file of this DAG will cause the program to be able to precisely recreate final results by reprocessing the workflow.

There is another wrinkle present in constructing this workflow diagram; there are no good UI interfaces for visually constructing a DAG that are available cross-platform (i.e. in Qt). Since I have to roll my own, I took inspiration from [Unity's Blueprint scripting engine](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/index.html) for the user experience, to be implemented in OpenGL, as most of the visuals are. Of course, implementing such a UI in OpenGL is not as trivial a task as it may seem; OpenGL offers no font rendering support; it's one of the few times in this program we need to use OpenGL cursor hit detection; there's a fairly normal, but unique in the program, amount of management of view space (i.e. zooming, panning) that needs to happen. Of course, since this program is not necessarily expected to be used by anyone other than myself, I get to build it however I want. YAGNI is always relaxed on personal projects.

For handling fonts, I'm implementing Valve's [distance field font](http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf) concept. I have of course dealt with texture-based font atlases; however, Valve's implementation is extremely clever and provides essentially hardware-accelerated runtime antialiasing. The constructed DAG of nodes uses a [Boost::Graph](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html) DAG with [Boost::Serialize](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html) "workspace" implementation and plugins that correspond to an API designed for future extensions and new operations. The completion of this feature is a major driving force for rewriting the prototype into a bona-fide native app, driven by the flaws in the prototype's image processing pipeline.

Status in prototype: 0% (not prototyped, the workflow is reprogrammed by hand for each case)

Status in native: 20% (a single command has been built and "hack-tested" to prove the concept and establish the api; ui space created for this purpose; font atlas generator created with serializable metadata for program use.)

* Red-cyan anaglyph generation

Anaglyph glasses are those stereotypical 3D "color filter" glasses with a red lens on the left and blue lens on the right. We can isolate the red chanel on the right image and the cyan (green and blue) color on the left image by multiplying with pure red (#FF000) and pure cyan (#00FFFF) to essentially do a bitwise-AND of only the relevant image data. We can then use the compositing operator "screen" to combine the red chanel into the blue image (or vice versa, screen is commutative), which has the effect of pulling the appropriate channels in while lightening the result. This generates an anaglyph image, which is the preferred method of generating static (as opposed to, e.g., a wigglegram) and device-independent (as opposed to requiring special equipment) 3D images, despite the drawback of not retaining true color and having issues with near-red and near-cyan elements in the image.

* Enhanced anaglyph generation

A huge downside to using the standard anaglyph workflow as described above is that the first image processing step is to slice some of the color information out of the image; this results in some near-red source color and near-cyan source color issues when viewed by a human, as described above. Rather than performing a bitwise AND of the source image data, it would be better to implement a filter which takes into account the energy of the correlated pixels _post-slice_, and reclaim some information from the sliced bits in order to prevent the cross-eye vibration artifacts present in anaglyph images. A simple filter is to modify the entire image on either side; this will in general, of course, have an effect over the entire image, which is not desirable. A better algorithm could be to examine pixel neighborhoods at similar disparity levels which seem to match and see if the luminosity for each eye is within an acceptable bounds; this is of course dependent upon the construction of the disparity map of the image as presented below. My a priori approach to properly implement this filter is to examine the disparity map (described below in the "reconstructing 3D geometry" section) for overlaps with strongly uncorrelated luminosity between images; these images will be re-examined in their original form for contour selection with OpenCV, then the contoured areas (potentially filtered for noise) with the most luminosity loss post-anaglyph will be modified from the original such that the resultant anaglyph has (closer) visual matching. The net effect will be that the shirt that appears _strongly_ blue (or nearly synonymous with white) in the cyan image, but which appears nearly black in the red image, will cause less visual vibration - it will be softened in the red image to a gray. Potential downsides to this could be that the human eye may compensate for this disparity due to our innate filtering ability; the result may be some sort of visual purple in the anaglyph. In this case, a new decision about how to process this region will have to be created.

This is the most complex operation of the entire program, dependent on not only a decent displacement matching algorithm, but also a decent workflow in itself to implement the results. Art is pain, I guess.

* Wigglegram generation

A wigglegram is an animated gif of the two images oscillating back and forth. [Here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosendahl/4720261964/sizes/o/) is an example (photo credit Flickr user rosendahl). This gives some sense of depth to the image based purely on our brain's ability to process parallax, and preserves the original coloration which is not possible in anaglyph images. It can be displayed on a computer or tablet that does not have specialized hardware for displaying 3D images, especially in situations where the original color retention is important. This simplistic construction method can be vastly improved; read below for more details on the 3D image geometry reconstruction feature.

* JPS file generation

A JPS file is a file type for stereoscopic JPEG images. It is essentially a side-by-side construction of 2 JPEG images packed into one file, with some metadata markers that describe the packing of the images. 3d-aware viewing devices (like my own polarized-glasses based 3D television) can often show these images natively in their galleries, providing a convenient and portable container for trading images. Some software can construct an anaglyph on the fly to display JPS files on a non-3d-enabled viewing platform, though of course, success in the enhanced anaglyph image as described about will likely be preferable.

Status in native: 0%

* Crop and resize capability as a pipeline step

These are basic functions that are useful for composition of an image outside of the camera. When viewing 3d images in a gallery, especially when 3d techniques such as a floating frame are used, the images tend to jump around from size to size, which is distracting. To correctly resize the images to appear of the same size requires a resize and crop functionality that operates on the images themselves early in the processing chain, before overlapping and floating frame operations have been applied, as these later steps provide extra padding horizontally, but not vertically, which alter the ability of other tools to successfully resize the images.

Status in prototype: 40% (basic crop and resize work, but are limited in where and how they can be applied).

Status in native: 0%

* Floating frame generation as a pipeline step

A floating frame is a technique to compensate for edge violation. When an image extends in front of the view plane (popping out at the viewer), if a feature crosses the left and right side of the frame, it is immediately obvious and uncomfortable to the viewer. One eye still sees much of the object, where another eye gets blocked by the edge of the frame. This effect does not happen on the top and bottom of the image, because our eyes are mounted side-by-side, leading to displacements that only violate at the left and right edge of the frame. By floating a frame in front of the view plane, that is, placing a frame around the images and then displacing it with the foreground geometry, then allowing the frame to appear in front of the view plane with its own margin, we can cut the images not at the view plane (where the true edge of the image is), but at the frame's apparent depth, or height. The effect is to push a frame out to the viewer at the same distance as the frontmost geometry, which corrects the edge violation.

* Annotation and signature as a pipeline step

When we have a frame, we might as well use it to title and annotate the image with text, as well as apply an artist's signature. To do this correctly, we have to float the annotation with the frame, meaning we have to apply the annotation separately to each frame before the final displacement happens. This pushes the text out of plane at the same displacement as the frame pushes out of plane, which means the signature appears on the surface of the frame.

Status in prototype: 80% (was working, but broken by regression)

Status in native: 0%

* Lens undistort as a pipeline step

My 3D camera setup has changed; originally, it was 2 point and shoot cameras that had fairly rectilinear lenses with only slight barrel distortion, which was acceptable to leave in the image when viewed by humans. The downside to this setup was the interocular distance of the lenses was 64mm, which is right about where the interpupillary distance of the average American man sits (64.7). Since the cameras cannot "toe in" in the same way that human eyes can, this means that there was a strict comfortable distance to the nearest object in the scene (or more correctly, a strict distance _ratio_ between the nearest and furthest object at which disparities get uncomfortable). To display correctly, everything in the scene must be seen without any eye crossing; the viewer's eyes have to replicate the near-parallel camera setup; the near point of the scene was around 1.5-2m for correct capture.

I recently upgraded to 2 GoPros in order to decrease the interocular distance, to around 40mm. This allows closer images to be taken, but has the obvious downside of a highly distorted image due to the GoPro's aspherical lens. There are good undistort tools available in ImageMagick, and even better in OpenCV with calibration images, but I determined experimentally that the undistort operation must occur at a specific point in the pipeline in order to produce the best results: after image correlation and overlapping, but before superimposing. This causes the distortion to affect the images relatively uniformly, causing any problems in the undistort model (cubic barrel distortion) to be corrected with the images "sticking" on top of each other. Undistortion prior to correlation can cause excess distortion toward the edges of the image, especially when the image plane point is off-center. This is one of the drivers for an explicit image pipeline to exist: correlate the images, then undistort to rectify geometry.

Status in prototype: 0% (experimentation was done with general purpose image manipulation tools)

Status in native: 0% (it's as yet unclear whether an undistort can be done to be visually and computationally satisfying, or whether GoPro images can even be universally rectified using barrel distortions. It may be possible that the aspherical lenses need different distortions at different depths from the lens; the most expedient action here would to be to use a 3rd-party lens retrofit for the GoPros to give them a more rectilinear image capture.)

* Automated correlation finding (edge detection and correlation)

Having a correlation point that ties the images together and defines the view plane is one of the many artistic choices that can be made when compositing the images, but the process of finding such a point can be tedious. Pixel-level precision requires zooming into the image to accurately place the correlation point; but detail is lost to the eye at close approach. A method to assist in selecting correlation points would be of great benefit to the workflow. OpenCV has some built-in tools for corner finding and feature detection that could provide a reasonable candidate set between images which would be of higer precision than requiring the user to zoom all the way in to a pixel-level detail.

* Batch processing of frames from side-by-side movies for generation of 3d movies.

All of the above features, when applied to a movie, with additional time-based tweening of some of the parameters (i.e. I've always been interested to determine if a dolly-zoom like effect can be built into a movie by tweening the view plane, which will push or pull the entire scene to the viewer). Essentially, allow keyframe-based, tweened model adjustments which bring many of the above features into the time domain.

* Generation of 3d scene from disparity data (construct geometry in OpenGL which allows small amounts of rotation and translation of the recreated scene)

If enough points of correlation between images can be found, the degree of horizontal shift (displacement in pixels) for each point can determine the degree of displacement from the image plane. In other words, a correlation can be seen as the intersection of two vectors projecting from the two cameras; the projection of one vector on the other camera defines an epiline, the line which represents a ray projected through Camera A's view plane as it appears on Camera B's image. Finding the point along this line where Camera B sees the same geometry defines a precise 3D point. When that point is found, the disparity along the epiline to the point of intersection can be triangulated to define the 3-dimensional location of the point.

Assuming a model where 2 calibrated cameras are planar and separated by their interocular distance, the epilines are horizontal, and knowing information about the cameras (i.e. the interocular distance) can enable us to calculate a depth distance for each point. These data can be used to create a point cloud, which can be meshed and textured with the images in order to recreate a 3d scene that can be slightly panned and tilted to recreate novel views of the original scene, within the limits of the original cameras to capture (features occluded in one or both images will, of course, yield no color or depth information).

Using these assumptions, some algorithms have been developed for stereo correspondance map finding. OpenCV has [some approaches that operate fairly well](http://docs.opencv.org/master/dd/d47/group__cudastereo.html#gsc.tab=0) for this purpose, including reprojecting to 3D space. The algorithm for generating the disparity map in our case will be [belief propagation](http://docs.opencv.org/master/de/d7a/classcv_1_1cuda_1_1StereoBeliefPropagation.html#gsc.tab=0), a technique that (as in many computer vision problems) begins by modeling the images as a [hidden markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model), i.e. the status of a particular pixel influences and is influenced by its direct neigbors' status. Status in this case means the hidden variable of disparity, or a measurement of how far a particular feature in 3D space is shifted between cameras' view planes. Belief propagation relies on a message passing algorithm to send beliefs, or a set of probabilities, between neighbors in order to converge on a most-likely belief for where the disparity of each pixel lies. For a humanistic interpretation, essentially the pixels "gossip" at each other to encourage slightly-misguided neighbors to comply with the group consensus. This will be the selected algorithm because it tends to do a good job while remaining extremely parallelizable, and therefore performant - OpenCV has a modified implementation of belief propagation in its cuda library, which means that the algorithm is run on the graphics processor and is therefore almost real-time.

Given the disparity map, we will construct a 3D point cloud (again [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/master/dd/d47/group__cudastereo.html#gaff851e3932da0f3e74d1be1d8855f094) helps us here) and use that to build a mesh of the scene. A detailed description of the mesh generation technique, and improvements to generalize to stereo images, is outlined below.

### An introduction to OpenVDB

OpenVDB is a DreamWorks-developed library for fast, efficient storage of large quantities of spatial data. It is the same code that was used for DreamWorks in its computer animated movies (e.g. Shrek) and has been integrated into many other projects, including Pixar's RenderMan.

OpenVDB in its core is simply a sparse tree-based representation of uniform voxels. The voxels are "notional" in memory (sparse) until populated with data, which allows efficient storage of discrete points in space. They rely heavily on C++ templates, which gives them better runtime characteristics (much of the processing for specialized implementation of the tree is done at compile time). Arbitrary data types can be stored in the tree, so, for instance, in using procedural generation of volume data for computer animation, it's possible to store a physics structure at each point in space and extract relevant information with iteration or coordinate accessors.

This simplifies my implementation immensely from when I first developed this algorithm (specified below), allowing its adaptation to a well-supported, open-sourced, and usefully-licensed library which has many tools - amongst which is a fast Poisson surface reconstruction of level sets tool and filters to pre-massage the data (for example, to reduce noise or to project to a different coordinate space) before mesh generation.

Therefore, the algorithm, at its highest level, becomes "just use OpenVDB". It's not _quite_ that simple (building OpenVDB was a pain, involving hand-editing the Makefile, and processing the image through OpenCV is not exactly trivial), but the basic algorithm as described below is more interesting for the extension sections operating on either the point cloud or the mesh rather than mesh generation, with data representation and surface reconstruction handled already.

## Legacy implementation

What follows below is a writeup of my previous (circa 2013 or so) design to handle this case. It shares a number of similarities with the OpenVDB implementation above, but is how I would have handled things "by scratch" and is for informational use only (and for design guidance should OpenVDB not pan out).

---

The problem of reconstructing the geometry is not trivial: we know (or model) that the geometry is sampled at a particular distance; we also know that the distances are noisy and inexact. We also need to model the surface as it transitions between distances, so a noisy, inexact surface presents many problems in constructing a consistent mesh by simple vertex connecting.

### A sidenote: simple vertex connections

Since we have a point cloud, we could easily connect the points together directly in order to form a mesh. A simple computational geometry algorithm would be to simply connect each vertex to its nearest 3 neigbors to form a triangle fan across the point cloud. This is fine for well-specified and accurate points, but may create a very jagged and inexact mesh with noisy data which sawtooths across the input data points. Depth clouds from stereo belief propagation will be fairly accurate in terms of representing the interiors (away from depth-edges) of objects, but at the edges there can be very stair-step artifacts that don't construct a good representation of the geometry, as can be seen in the results of [this paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jiansun/papers/Stereo_PAMI.pdf)

The most common approach to solving this problem is to create a model of an isosurface, where every value of a scalar field is the same on the surface. Points that are inside and outside the surface can be found by comparing their location to the nearest intersection of the isosurface. When the isosurface is binary and not continually varying, it's called a _level set_. Reconstructiong a function that represents the level set then leads itself naturally to using [marching cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) to map a new surface that approximates the level set in mesh form. The problem then becomes how to construct an isosurface that represents, but is not identical to, the points in the point cloud, which allows us to modify (i.e. smooth or warp) the point cloud to deal with noise or time-based changes in the level set.

There are very good techniques that have been developed to a high degree of fidelity, such as [poisson surface reconstruction](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/proj/poissonrecon/). These methods attempt to map higher-order features of the point cloud to the surface, maintaining not only a location accuracy at small scales but also gradient and gradient rate (divergence) accuracy. This is important for accurately reconstructing the surface with smooth curvature, but is computationally intensive for this purpose; lower-level techniques provide good representations while losing some of this higher-derivative data, focusing on matching location only with no guarantees about smoothness of transition between points. Higher-order methods are important for reconstructing enough information to provide good, smooth normals behavior such that effects such as lighting are accurately rendered; however, I will be rendering no lighting in the scene (all lighting is in the real world and built into the textures; in effect, all lighting is already [lightmapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightmap) on the real-world images) so there is no need to retain curvature at the cost of extra computational complexity. Therefore, we regress to an earlier state of the art, which lends itself to a faster and simpler implementation at the loss of data that is less relevant for this use case.

Hugues Hoppe is an advanced graphics researcher at Microsoft, and he is the author or co-author of more or less _the_ authoritative development path for surface reconstruction. His [doctoral thesis](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/thesis.pdf) from 1994 covers a simple, scalable, and adaptable technique that I will adapt to this problem. The technique is to construct a series of representative planes from a neighborhood of points, by building the planes as an optimization problem to fit the neighborhood. The planes are constructed as the least squares plane fitting to the neighborhood, where the neighborhood size is a parameter of the algorithm (but can be dynamically constructed as a one-off to be "the closest N points to the given point") to deal with sampling variation. Given these points, the plane intersects the centroid of the neighborhood, and the normal vector is found from principal component analysis of the points. This provides enough information to act as a "local representative slice" of the point cloud function.

Principal component analysis deals with defining a rotation of the standard cartesian coordinates into one where the minimal variances of the data lie on x', y', z'. In other words, the data will assuredly _not_ fall such that the grouping of points in the neighborhood is symmetric and distributed evenly amongst all of global X, Y, and Z, but rather be rotated in some direction from the global coordinate plane. This rotation direction is specified by the principal components of the data, orthogonal vectors that point in the direction of the greatest, second greatest, and third greatest variances. 

(Side note: I first experienced PCA in my mechanical engineering classes in order to calculate the principal directions of combined stress in a material - if you perform PCA on an infinitesimal point within the material, you orient the stresses such that the principal components point _only in_ directions of tensile stress. Therefore, any combination of stresses on a material can be modeled as tensile stress in the direction of the principal coordinates, which is why mechanical engineers only need to perform stress tests on materials for tension and not shear - shear is modeled as internal tension. This simplifies finite element analysis immensely. I think it's so cool when math overlaps multiple fields of application.)

Therefore, a covariance matrix of the data is created. A covariance matrix is the outer product of the expected value deviations of the independent variables of a system - that is, given that we are looking at x, y, and z in the local neighborhood (relative to the centroid). The covariance matrix is then

    [ex*ex, ex*ey, ex*ez]
    [ey*ex, ey*ey, ey*ex]
    [ez*ex, ez*ey, ez*ez]

`ex` and so forth in this Markdown-limited notation refers to the sum of residuals for each variable. The most intuitive way to think of the covariance matrix is to realize that the diagonals are the variances in the X, Y, Z directions, and the off-diagonal values represent the combination of residuals in combined directions across pair-dimensions which is analogous to the role of the variance in axis-aligned dimensions. 

The covariance used in Hoppe's thesis is selected from a near neighborhood of local points; neighborhood size is an input parameter to his algorithm.

Performing principle component analysis on the covariance matrix involves taking the three eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues based on the distribution of the data. If you think about what's happening with a point cloud, it's not too hard to determine that these eigenvectors are oriented in the maximally greatest distribution of the points in the local cloud in each direction - the principal components. These vectors are orthogonal, with the eigenvalues representing a measure of the spread of the data, so the third eigenvector (the one with the lowest eigenvalue) points in the direction of the least significant spread of the plane, which yields the (positive or negative) normal vector. Therefore, the definition of the plane is represented by the third principal component vector (to within a sign) located at the centroid of the neighborhood.

This plane can have 2 orientations: "inward" and "outward" facing. At this point Hoppe must chase down a graph optimization problem to find the sign of the normal vector, as he assumes no information about the capture method and a completely disorganized field of 3D points only (no normals); we have an advantage here: the cameras can _only_ take images of the outward-facing normals of objects (in the real world, there is no "behind" or "interior" to the surface of a solid to be imaged by a camera). Therefore, the correct normal is the one with the angle to either camera's look vector to that point (the vector connecting the focal point and the point on the real-world geometry) with a value greater than 90 degrees. In other words, the correct vector has a negative dot product with the vector from focal point to centroid of the cloud. This represents, intuitively, the capture vector pointing to the geometry and the geometry's normals pointing "back-ish" toward the cameras.

Finally, the surface is modeled in sufficient detail to calculate the piecewise level set, used to calculate containment of the vertices of the marching cube voxels. A point is on the camera-side (exterior) of the level set if and only if it is on the near side of the plane associated with the closest piecewise representation of on the level set. This is how marching cubes can be used to remesh noisy data, essentially using a neighborhood-average smoothing filter from the principal component analysis.

### Extension: scalability

This algorithm represents some low-hanging fruit in terms of scaling. First, we adaptively construct the point cloud neighborhoods not as discrete locations in space, but contained within an octree. The octree can be constructed with some optimizing steps in order to restrict the number of levels of descent:

1) Number of points in the octant: a minimum number of points can signal a stop to the space subdivision, and a maximum number of points can _require_ a further subdivision
2) Size of the octant: some percentage of the size of the scene can be used to define the maximum and minimum octant size. In practice, this simply resolves to a minimum and maximum number of levels to subdivide space into
3) Data structure of points in the octant. Performing principal component analysis on each octant during subdivision can find information on the spread of the data. If the octant is found to already be a "flat plane" in terms of the ratio of the smallest eigenvalue to the larger eigenvalues at some intermediate stage of subdivision, the octant is already representing a flat plane at every subdivision, so has no need to be further subdivided.

Implementing the octree, then, effectively creates a non-uniform size and location of point cloud neighborhoods, where the distribution of neighborhoods is more sparse in areas of low surface curvature and higher in areas of high surface curvature, resulting in a minimal loss of detail at the surface definition stage while acting as a lossy filter of less-important data for defining the surface. These parameters can be scaled in real time to handle generation of the surface at differing levels of resolution, allowing for a tradeoff to be made between performance and fidelity. Negative aspects of using a data-agnostic octree of this type can be that it may artificially partition the surface into more neighborhoods than necessary (e.g. defining a partition across a flat plane and then finding the level set will create 2 "almost identical" planes instead of the ideal single plane). The effect of this would be to multiply-define the level set unnecessarily; however this multiple definition will never be as redundant as the uniformly distributed neighborhood selection process with a uniform subdivision of the points, and will not result in incorrect surface definition, as two (very nearly) identical plane definitions will represent a very similar isosurface function to the non-redundant solution. Therefore, it's not worth the time and effort to deduplicate the level set definiton.

### Extension: parallelization and distribution

The use of the octree, as presented above, allows for the neighborhood analysis and surface generation steps to be easily and naturally partitioned. Each octant is processed separately without regard to the state or status of neighboring siblings, so development of an octree-partitioned job distribution can trivially be done to parallelize the workload across multiple threads of execution, multiple memory spaces, multiple machines, or (potentially, depending on core size constraints) multiple independent work units on a graphics processor. The tradeoff is the same as stated above: there may be artificial partitions of the data, but these artificial partitions result simply in a redundant and nearly identical definition for the isosurface which is harmless for our purposes.

### Extension: video data

Not included in Hoppe's algorithm, but a clear extension, would be to incorporate some sort of smoothing between frames of video data. Since we know that extractions of frames from the video data do not offer any more resolution in the depth direction as in the still data, and also that the cameras themselves may be moving and rotating during the duration of the video, naively performing surface reconstruction at each frame would be an uncomfortable experience for the user: the isosurface from frame to frame may have no strong relationship to that of the previous frame, which means the tesselation could shift violently, oscillate, or fluctuate regardless of real changes in the surface geometry.

Here, we reuse the covariance matrix from the surface reconstruction to help us out. As we process the neighborhoods of the surface generation algorithm, if we find that a particular neighborhood is geometrically aligned with the previous frame's octree - that is, the neighborhood taken for surface definition is found to reside at the same depth in the octree, and not higher or lower - then this neighborhood can be said to share identity with the previous neighborhood at that location.

This approach allows us to associate a similarity in underlying surface as defined by that neighborhood, which I will call the _control point_ of the surface. Similar to a spline's control point, the surface control point is instrumental in defining the shape of the surface by its location, in this case, that that location has a similar geometric distribution across time and therefore likely represents similar geometry. The proof is conceptually easy to grasp (and should be mathematically provable, though I have not done so) by contradiction: if the octree were of a different topology, that would imply that the underlying geometry has changed enough to warant breaking the time relationship between frames. Therefore, similar topology is similar geometry. 

The challenge, then, is to model this control point as having some sort of motion that allows for filtered fluctuation of the surface, such that the experience is not disconcerting to the user and filters out noise and rapid change. This is easily modeled by a [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter), which I used at Lockheed Martin to simulate the (uncertain) movement of suborbital objects with (uncertain) sensor fusion and (uncertain) disturbance noise. A Kalman filter additionally has a control term with its own uncertainty, or a term to update the model with the internal state as known by some controller, but which is not used here as we have no feedback to how a known state of change would be expected to be represented, e.g. as if we would if the location and orientation is directly measured and can be fed forward into the filter.

The Kalman filter follows the Markov property across time (i.e. the updated state depends only on the previous state) and spans 2 main stages:

* prediction:
  Update the internal state "open loop" without having sensor data play any part. For this case, that model is generally "should stay relatively still".

* correction:
  Use the sensor data to refine an updated version of the internal state. This is a new remeasuring of the previously calculated state.

Essentially, a Kalman filter is much like "walking down the hall with your eyes shut and opening them once per second". Using your internal knowledge about how your body moves, you update your internal state by dead reckoning until you open your eyes. For this brief look, you correct your dead reckoned state with additional knowledge that enables you to filter out any drift or uncertainty from your dead reckoned state update.

Using this with the video data requires modeling the position of the control point, as well as defining how it is allowed to move across time. By adjusting the motion parameters to infer stillness (i.e. no motion at all), or slowly adapt to small motions with a moderate "momentum" term (which would allow some motion fluctuation to be smoothed within that octree), we can constrain the points to undergo a filtered and controlled motion update.

A key component of the Kalman filter is modeling uncertainty in the model motion, then combining that uncertainty with data from one or more uncertain measurements. The uncertainty of a Kalman filter is typically modeled with a Gaussian distribution, which has the convenient property that the multiplication of 2 Gaussian distributions is itself a Gaussian distribution, so each step propagates a "real continuing uncertainty" across steps.

Finally, these Gaussian distributions are modeled as _a covariance matrix of single-variable Gaussians_.

The errors need not be Gaussian, but they typically are, as they provide a exact probability estimate in the case that all the errors are Gaussian, which is generally the case (or a good first-order assumption) for both physical systems and measurement systems. Generally, as well, these data are not known at application time, but are estimated from calibration data. If we modify the covariance matrix from the mesh step to find the principal components of the Gaussian distribution of the points, we can implement a Kalman filter on the control points which tracks them through space and time within a _measurable_ uncertainty in 3D space, which is a nice feature we get for a very inexpensive slight modification to the control point covariance calculation.

This has the added benefit that measurements over time in a Kalmann filter tend to aggregate in our favor, which is why it was used to track trajectories at Lockheed: because the Kalman filter is a Markov model, it's simple and performant to implement, but the aggregation of the uncertainties being removed frame-by-frame enables the successive frames to much more precisely locate a control point than can be done in a single frame. In other words, a single noisy measurement i.e. a jounce or motion of the camera during filming) is slowly aggregated with successive better measurements to create a better estimate than any one measurement provides, without having to track the time history of the measurements.

### Extension: multiple manifolds

So far, the octree represents a level set function for a single discontinuous manifold, which is not universally true in real geometry, which results in some potential errors in interpretation of the data. The result is that we have a projected shell, with the occluded geometry not represented on the mesh (edges are determined by the granularity of the marching cubes algorithm; when sufficiently far away from the base of any normal vector, we do not consider the level set to be defined in that neighborhood). Additionally, when there are objects located in the near foreground sufficiently close that they occlude non-contiguous space in the background, that is, their respective occusion of their backgrounds share no pixels, this negative parallax is enough to provide enough "look-around" capability to break a background into multiple sections, creating holes where occlusions occur in either image. However, from how we are calculating our depth data, the belief propagation algorithm will have a hard time handling this situation; it implicitly assumes (due to the disparity buffer being a 2d image storing the displacement data) that we're dealing with a single manifold.

Additionally, if we have multiple disparity maps from multiple views of the scene, we can combine the resulting point clouds to get more data about the scene than a single view alone affords. This informs an important step of the algorithm: we must heal the surface of a discontinuous number of objects in order to correctly render the scene, removing edges so that there are no unobstructed views to the background when viewing the scene from novel views. This allows a greater number of novel views to be constructed where the errors become visible as oblique false planes (not present in the original geometry) as opposed to gaps in the scene, which are more disruptive.

The algorithm for cube corner inclusion in the mesh generation step then also varies from Hoppe's algorithm: where he modeled with explicit through holes by requiring a point to be within some sigma of a sample, I am modeling inclusion to be any point that is interior to all surfaces, that is, the set intersection of the level sets.

This has the result that not only will we be able to view the scene from the local vantage point of either camera and have it appear correctly, we can view the scene from anywhere along the line connecting the camera sensors' focal points and get correct geometry. Extending this, using 3 sensors, it is possible to view the scene from anywhere interior to the triangle defined by the focal points, and using 4 sensors will enable correct viewing from anywhere within the (possibly skewed) tetrahedral volume and see the scene correctly.


### Extension: sensor fusion

A significant driving factor of using a Kalman filter for geometry control is that Kalman filters are explicitly designed to gracefully handle sensor fusion. If we have one stereo camera construct a point cloud of control points, and another stereo camera construct a point cloud of control points, then they can provide sensor data which improves the measurements of the other camera. This is clear due to the fact that the novel view of the second (or more) sensors contribute to a separate measurement of the scene.

The requirement here would be for some system to correlate control points between cameras. This is precisely the same problem as stereo correspondence: given an epipolar constraint between cameras, it's possible to provide data between cameras on where a particular point is located from the other camera's epiline. With 3D data, however, we can use a correlative approach instead of a probabilistic one (as in belief propagation). Since we can define a control point based on its individual octant in the camera's scene space, and we can define an epigeometric transform between cameras (so long as we know or can calculate their position and orientation relative to each other), we can construct a representative coordinate in the second camera's coordinate system. Given the points in this second camera's point cloud, we can recalculate the covariance matrix from this second view with the same data points, and feed this covariance matrix directly into the first camera's Kalman filter to produce a significantly improved estimate of the state of the geometry in that space.

This was the purpose of the Kalman filter for sensing in the projects I worked on at Lockheed: radars and infrared cameras have quite different error covariances (radars are very accurate in range, but not so accurate in elevation or azimuth; cameras are more accurate in azimuth and elevation, but have no range data at all). By combining these two covariances as individual measurements of the same objects' state, you obtain the mathematical product of their distributions, which slices any long tails off of the resulting uncertainty. In addition, if these sensors are at different coordinates, seeing the object with different points of view, the effect is even more pronounced, using accurate measurements on one platform along the axes of the inaccurate measurements of the other one and yielding a very precise pinpoint location of the object.
